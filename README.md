# 📊 Flipkart Review Sentiment Analysis

This Streamlit app predicts whether a Flipkart review is positive or negative based on the review text and rating. The app utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier to perform sentiment analysis and provides insightful visualizations for better understanding.

## 🚀 Features

- **Sentiment Prediction**: Input a review text and rating to get the predicted sentiment (positive or negative).
- **Confusion Matrix Visualization**: Visualize the confusion matrix of the model on the test dataset to understand model performance.
- **Word Cloud**: Display a word cloud for positive reviews to highlight common words.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flipkart-sentiment-analysis.git
    cd flipkart-sentiment-analysis
    ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit scikit-learn nltk wordcloud pandas matplotlib seaborn tqdm
    ```

## 📋 Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit app:**

## 📁 Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main Streamlit app script.
- `flipkart_data.csv`: The dataset containing Flipkart reviews and ratings.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `LICENSE`: License information.

## 🔍 Data Preprocessing

The reviews undergo the following preprocessing steps:
- **Removing punctuation**.
- **Converting to lowercase**.
- **Removing stopwords** using NLTK.

## 📈 Model

The app uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict the sentiment of the reviews. The model is trained on a subset of the data and evaluated on a separate test set.

## 🖼️ Visualizations

- **Confusion Matrix**: Displays the model's performance on the test set.
- **Word Cloud**: Visualizes common words in positive reviews.

## 🧪 Example

1. **Input a review**: "This product is amazing!"
2. **Input a rating**: 5
3. **Click "Predict Sentiment"**
4. **Output**: "The review sentiment is: Positive"
